# **Cult Wars**

This is a 2D top-down local multiplayer game where players compete as cultists trying to be the first to build their altars.
It is a prototype I made in my third year of University. I have revived it this year and have updated it from Unity 5 to Unity 2022.3, have implemented the new input system for more versatile controller support and am otherwise refactoring and reworking it to improve its base so new content can be added.
